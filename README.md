# Animal Computer Vision Clean Dataset and Code (CNN - AI)

---
I am sharing a clean dataset about animals with you. In addition, I am sharing an artificial intelligence classification software with 97% accuracy. The data was trained on approximately 9 ready-made models and a total of 10 models were trained, including the model I created. The MSE value is 0.07, the accuracy value is 97% and the precision value is 98%.

Classes = Zebra, Rhino, Elephant and Buffalo
