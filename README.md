# Human Action Detection with Artificial Intelligence - Emirhan BULUT

---
I made an artificial intelligence CNN software that detects and classifies human movements. I trained 9 ready-made models and added 1 36-layer CNN artificial intelligence algorithm (model) that I created myself to the software. In order for the code to be instructive and understandable, I interpreted the code blocks with the help of notebook-like titles. I shared the dataset and software with humanity for free on Kaggle and GitHub.

Enjoyable software...
